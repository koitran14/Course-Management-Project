### After this project, we aim to gain:
- Master theories of the Principle of Database Management with MVC patternâœ¨
- Learn new techniques of Web Application Programming with NextJS, NodeJS, SQL Server,...âœ¨
- Teamwork skillsâœ¨

## Technique 
To do this project, we use: 
- Language: `Typescript, JavaScript, SQL Queries`
- Techniques/Frameworks: `React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, SQL Server`
- Model: `MVC System`.
- IDE: `VsCode`, `SQL Server`.

## Features
âœ¨ Authentication & Authorization. <br/>
âœ¨ Announcements. <br/>
âœ¨ Contents. <br/>
âœ¨ Assignments with Due Date Alerts. <br/>
âœ¨ Attachments with. <br/>
âœ¨ Interactive statistic tables for Grade Collection. <br/>

# Installation
### âœ¨ Cloning the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/koitran14/Course-Management-Project.git
```

## Result
During the project, our team successfully achieved the goal of developing the learning management system. Firstly, we design a database to adhere to the requirement of B.C Normal Form, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval while eliminating data anomalies. Secondly, we connect the front-end interface of the application to the back-end database using Nodejs, establishing a seamless and secure connection between the authorization and authentication system, edit profile, add/ remove/edit course elements, access course elements and file attachments, implementing complex queries to manage various scenarios effectively.
Through completing these goals, our project has delivered a reliable and user-friendly learning management system that meets the requirements of modern database management, security, and multi-role user experience.

## Limitation
Furthermore, the game possesses several constraints. Specifically, the game remains unfinished due to time constraints and a lack of sufficient experience and expertise. Consequently, the classes and methods lack proper organization, efficiency, and cleanliness, making testing a rather complex task. Most importantly, the team encountered challenges in constructing, coordinating, and assigning tasks, occasionally necessitating starting over due to inexperience and confusion in the game development process.
